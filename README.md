# StringAlgorithmsProblemSets
problem sets for Coursera course "Algorithms on Strings" from UCSD and National Research University Higher School of Economics (Russia)
Starter code and problems are from the course. All other code was written by me (Avraham Kahan)
The reason structs are used instead of classes for the most part is that the verbosity of classes is not justified for the short problem sets, whose solution must be included in a single .cpp file. 
The short nature of the problems is also why the code is not well modulated or commented
