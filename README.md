# StringAlgorithmsProblemSets
problem sets for Coursera course "Algorithms on Strings" from UCSD
The reason structs are used instead of classes for the most part is that the verbosity of classes is not justified for the short problem sets, whose solution must be included in a single .cpp file. 
The short nature of the problems is also why the code is not well modulated or commented
